                <h3>What makes RoomMagnet different?</h3>
                <p>RoomMagnet provides an easy to use platform where pre-screened Tenants and Hosts come together, and in exchange for a modest cost and/or in exchange for light domestic duties, enjoy reduced rent. It’s a win-win! Hosts monetize their extra living space and if they wish get a little help around the house. Tenants enjoy affordable housing.

                <h3>Who can use Roommagnet?</h3>
                <p>Roommagnet users must be at least 18 years of age and are seeking a minimum of 30 days stay in Host lodging. While Roommagnet is open to all who meet their minimum requirements we specialize in connecting Hosts with professional and semi-professionals such as, graduate students, international students, doctoral and nursing interns as well as college students seeking affordable off campus housing.

                <h3>Who are host families?</h3>
                <p>Host families are those who have room in their home, empty-nesters and people of advanced age who wish to age in place, and wish to monetize their empty space. In cases where hosts are interested in getting a little help around the house and tenants are willing  provide assistance with things such as light domestic or outdoor work, running errands, as well as companionship a further rent discount will be offered by the host and negotiated between host and tenant.

                <h3>What is the advantage to a host family?</h3>
                <p>Roommagnet connects host families who wish to share empty space in their home with responsible inter-generational adults who seek affordable housing in order to continue their careers. These may be advanced college students, doctoral and nursing interns, international students or professionals. Host families have the assurance that Tenants are carefully screened.
Hosts who need assistance with light domestic duties (i.e. shopping, household odd jobs, daily maintenance or just companionship) will offer further discount for assistance.

                <h3>Why is there a need for RoomMagnet?</h3>
                <p>As the cost of housing increases and become more scarce in highly populated areas, it becomes harder for responsible students, as well as professional and semi-professionals (ie: doctoral interns, and interning nurses) to find suitable and affordable housing. Likewise, International students not only have the added expense of international living, but also must adjust to the cultural landscape of the U.S., which living with a host family can greatly reduce.

                <h3>What is RoomMagnet’s background screening procedure?</h3>
                <p>We strongly suggest all RoomMagnet users ( Tenants and Hosts) who wish to connect on our platform initiate a background check. We ask this so that our users feel secure in taking advantage of the benefits of RoomMagnet. Hosts or Tenants may request, and rely upon one or more consumer reports or investigative consumer reports to determine a compatible living arrangement.
Please keep in mind that should a Tenant and/or Host proceed without a background screen you will limit your ability to find a preferred match.

                <p>RoomMagnet does not charge either Tenants or Hosts a fee to register, develop a profile, list a property or search. RoomMagnet earns a match fee of one month’s rent for rentals 180 days or more once Hosts and Tenants connect and initiate the company’s letter of intent indicating a desirable match and a start date for occupancy.

Such commission will be deducted from the first month’s base rental rate with the balance then forwarded to the host through their stripe account

                <h3>How will hosts get paid?</h3>
                <p>In order for RoomMagnet to disperse funds, landlords (hosts) will need to set up a simple stripe account. This will enable funds to be distributed directly and quickly to the Hosts account. Stripe is a network with redundant security encryption, and all information is kept strictly confidential. 
Stripe is a recognized secure payment platform that works similar to Paypal in that it collects payments from RoomMagnet Renters (Tenants) and automatically disperses funds to Landlords (Hosts).
